### Contributing
We will be using gitflow as a standard collaborating flow. This is a good start to read https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow.

Before you commit and push to your branch, make sure you have tested it out, and rebase your branch if necessary. After you've finished with your feature branch, don't forget to create a pull request (PR) to develop branch. Keep the PR small and clean!

Happy contributing!
